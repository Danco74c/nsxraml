#NSX RAML

This repository holds a RAML specification of the NSX for vSphere 6.x API.
For more details on RAML, please visit http://raml.org.

This RAML file has been generated from information that can be found in the "NSX vSphere API Guide" documenation that is  available in PDF format at vmware.com.

The purpose of this package is to be used as the basis in building dynamic API clients for the NSX for vSphere API and for the automatic generation of API documentation.

An example of one such dynamic client that uses the NSX RAML specification is the Python 'nsxramlclient' that can be found at:
http://github.com/vmware/nsxramlclient

In addition to the RAML file itself, three artifacts are provided that are generated by the tools raml2html, raml2md and raml2postman:
- In /html-version/ there is a HTML file generated by raml2html that can be viewed in a browser.
- Likewise, /md-version/ contains a markdown file generated by raml2md.
- Finally, in /postman-collection/ there are postman collection and postman environments files generated by raml2postman

You can find more information on the raml2html and raml2md tools on Kevin Renkser's Github

Details on raml2postman can be found on postmanlabs github
