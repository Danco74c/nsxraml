This manual, the NSX for vSphere API Guide, describes how to install, configure, monitor, and maintain the VMwareÂ® NSX system by using REST API requests.

## Intended Audience

This manual is intended for anyone who wants to use REST API to programmatically control NSX in a VMware vSphere environment. The information in this manual is written for experienced developers who are familiar with virtual machine technology, virtualized datacenter operations, and REST APIs. This manual also assumes familiarity with NSX for vSphere.

The NSX Manager requires port 443/TCP for REST API requests.

## Finding vCenter Object IDs

Many API methods reference vCenter object IDs in URI parameters, query
parameters, request bodies, and response bodies. You can find vCenter object
IDs via the vCenter Managed Object Browser.

### Find Datacenter ID

1. In a web browser, enter the vCenter Managed Object Browser URL:
   `http://vCenter-IP-Address/mob`.
2. Click **content**.
3. Find **rootFolder** in the Name column, and click the corresponding link in
   the Value column. e.g. *group-d1*.
4. Find the **childEntity** in the Name column, and the corresponding
  Value column entry is the datacenter MOID. e.g. *datacenter-21*.

### Find Host ID

1. In a web browser, enter the vCenter Managed Object Browser URL:
   `http://vCenter-IP-Address/mob`.
2. Click **content**.
3. Find **rootFolder** in the Name column, and click the corresponding link in
   the Value column. e.g. *group-d1*.
4. Find **childEntity** in the Name column, and click the corresponding
   link in the Value column. e.g. *datacenter-21*.
4. Find **hostFolder** in the Name column, and click the corresponding
   link in the Value column. e.g. *group-h23*.
4. Find **childEntity** in the Name column. The corresponding Value column
   contains links to host clusters. Click the appropriate host cluster link.
   e.g. *domain-c33*.
4. Find *host* in the Name column. The corresponding Value column
   lists the hosts in that cluster by vCenter MOID and hostname. e.g.
   *host-32 (esx-02a.corp.local)*.

### Find Portgroup ID

1. In a web browser, enter the vCenter Managed Object Browser URL:
   `http://vCenter-IP-Address/mob`.
2. Click **content**.
3. Find **rootFolder** in the Name column, and click the corresponding link in
   the Value column. e.g. *group-d1*.
4. Find **childEntity** in the Name column, and click the corresponding
   link in the Value column. e.g. *datacenter-21*.
4. Find **hostFolder** in the Name column, and click the corresponding
   link in the Value column. e.g. *group-h23*.
4. Find **childEntity** in the Name column. The corresponding Value column
   contains links to host clusters. Click the appropriate host cluster link.
   e.g. *domain-c33*.
4. Find **host** in the Name column. The corresponding Value column lists the
   hosts in that cluster by vCenter MOID and hostname. Click the appropriate
   host link, e.g. host-32.
5. Find **network** in the Name column. The corresponding Value column lists
   the port groups on that host, e.g. *dvportgroup-388*.

### Find VMID

1. In a web browser, enter the vCenter Managed Object Browser URL:
   `http://vCenter-IP-Address/mob`.
2. Click **content**.
3. Find **rootFolder** in the Name column, and click the corresponding link in
   the Value column. e.g. *group-d1*.
4. Find **childEntity** in the Name column, and click the corresponding
   link in the Value column. e.g. *datacenter-21*.
4. Find **hostFolder** in the Name column, and click the corresponding
   link in the Value column. e.g. *group-h23*.
4. Find **childEntity** in the Name column. The corresponding Value column
   contains links to host clusters. Click the appropriate host cluster link.
   e.g. *domain-c33*.
4. Find **host** in the Name column. The corresponding Value column lists the
   hosts in that cluster by vCenter MOID and hostname. Click the appropriate
   host link, e.g. host-32.
5. Find **vm** in the Name column. The corresponding Value column lists the
   virtual machines by vCenter MOID and hostname. e.g. *vm-216 (web-01a)*.
