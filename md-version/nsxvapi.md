## vdsManage
Working with vSphere Distributed Switches
===========

### /2.0/vdn/switches

* **post** *(secured)*: Prepare a vSphere Distributed Switch.

The MTU is the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted in one
packet before it is divided into smaller packets. VXLAN frames are slightly
larger in size because of the traffic encapsulation, so the MTU required
is higher than the standard MTU. You must set the MTU for each switch to
1602 or higher.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve information about all vSphere Distributed Switches.

### /2.0/vdn/switches/datacenter/{datacenterID}
Working with vSphere Distributed Switches in a Datacenter
------

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve information about all vSphere Distributed Switches in the specified datacenter.

### /2.0/vdn/switches/{vdsId}
Working With a Specific vSphere Distributed Switch
------

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve information about the specified vSphere Distributed Switch.

* **delete** *(secured)*: Delete the specified vSphere Distributed Switch.

## vdnConfig
Working with Segement ID Pools and Multicast Ranges
========

### /2.0/vdn/config/segments
Working With Segment ID Pools
-------------
Segment ID pools (also called segment ID ranges) provide virtual network
identifiers (VNIs) to logical switches.

You must configure a segment ID pool for each NSX Manager. You can have
more than one segment ID pool. The segment ID pool includes the beginning
and ending IDs.

You should not configure more than 10,000 VNIs in a single vCenter
server because vCenter limits the number of dvPortgroups to 10,000.

If any of your transport zones will use multicast or hybrid replication
mode, you must also configure a multicast address range.

* **post** *(secured)*: Add a segment ID pool.

* **name** - Required property.
* **desc** - Optional property.
* **begin** - Required property. Minimum value is *5000*
* **end** - Required property. Maximum value is *16777216*

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve information about all segment ID pools.

### /2.0/vdn/config/segments/{segmentPoolId}
Working With a Specific Segment ID Pool
------

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve information about the specified segment ID pool.

* **put** *(secured)*: Update the specified segment ID pool.

If the segment ID pool is universal you must send the API request to
the primary NSX Manager.

* **delete** *(secured)*: Delete the specified segment ID pool.

If the segment ID pool is universal you must send the API request to
the primary NSX Manager.

### /2.0/vdn/config/multicasts
Working with Multicast Address Ranges
------
If any of your transport zones will use multicast or hybrid replication
mode, you must add a multicast address range (also called a multicast
address pool). Specifying a multicast address range helps in spreading
traffic across your network to avoid overloading a single multicast
address.

* **post** *(secured)*: Add a multicast address range for logical switches.

The address range includes the beginning and ending addresses.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve information about all configured multicast address ranges.

Universal multicast address ranges have the property isUniversal
set to *true*.

### /2.0/vdn/config/multicasts/{multicastAddresssRangeId}
Working With a Specific Multicast Address Range
--------

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve information about the specified multicast address range.

* **put** *(secured)*: Update the specified multicast address range.

If the multicast address range is universal you must send the API
request to the primary NSX Manager.

* **delete** *(secured)*: Delete the specified multicast address range.

If the multicast address range is universal you must send the API
request to the primary NSX Manager.

### /2.0/vdn/config/vxlan/udp/port
Working with the VXLAN Port Configuration
----------

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve the UDP port configured for VXLAN traffic.

### /2.0/vdn/config/vxlan/udp/port/{portNumber}
Update the VXLAN Port Configuration
-------

This method changes the VXLAN port in a three phrase process, avoiding
disruption of VXLAN traffic. In a cross-vCenter NSX environment,
change the VXLAN port on the primary NSX Manager to propagate this
change on all NSX Managers and hosts in the cross-vCenter NSX
environment.

**Method history:**

Release | Modification
--------|-------------
6.2.3 | Method updated. Port change is now non-disruptive, and propagates to secondary NSX Managers if performed on the primary NSX Manager. Force parameter added.

### /2.0/vdn/config/vxlan/udp/port/taskStatus
VXLAN Port Configuration Update Status

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve the status of the VXLAN port configuration update.

**Method history:**

Release | Modification
--------|-------------
6.2.3 | Method introduced.

### /2.0/vdn/config/resources/allocated

Working with a Specific Transport Zone
---------

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve information about the specified transport zone.

* **post** *(secured)*: Update the specified transport zone.

You can add a cluster to or delete a cluster from a transport zone.

You can also repair missing portgroups. For every logical switch
created, NSX creates a corresponding portgroup in vCenter. If the
portgroup is lost for any reason, the logical switch will stop
functioning. The repair action recreates any missing portgroups.

* **delete** *(secured)*: Delete the specified transport zone.

### /2.0/vdn/scopes/{scopeId}/attributes
Working With Transport Zone Attributes
----

* **put** *(secured)*: Update the attributes of a transport zone.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve information about all logical switches in the specified
transport zone (network scope).

* **post** *(secured)*: Create a logical switch.

To create a universal logical switch use *universalvdnscope* as the
scopeId in the URI and send the request to the primary NSX Manager.
Request body parameters:
  * **name** - Optional. The name of the logical switch.
  * **description** - Optional. Description of the logical switch.
  * **tenantId** - Required.
  * **controlPlaneMode** - Optional. The control plane mode. If not
    specified, the **controlPlaneMode** of the transport zone is used. It
    can be one of the following:
      * *UNICAST_MODE*
      * *HYBRID_MODE*
      * *MULTICAST_MODE*
  * **guestVlanAllowed** - Optional. Default is *false*.

## traceflows
Working with Traceflow
================
For Traceflow to work as expected, make sure that the controller cluster is
connected and in healthy state. The Traceflow operation requires active
communication between vCenter, NSX Manager, controller cluster, and netcpa
User World Agents (UWA) on the host. Traceflow observes marked packet as it
traverses overlay network. Each packet is delivered to host VM and
monitored as it crosses overlay network until it reaches the destination
VM. The packet is never delivered to the destination guest VM. This means
that Traceflow packet delivery is successful even when the guest VM is
powered down. Unknown L2 Packets are always be sent to the bridge.
Typically, the bridge forwards these packets to a VLAN and reports the
Traceflow packet as delivered. The packet which is reported as delivered
need not necessarily mean that the trace packet was delivered to the
destination specified. You should conclude only after validating the
observations.vdl2 serves ARP proxy for ARP packets coming from VMs.
However, traceflow bypasses this process, hence vdl2 may broadcast the
traceflow packet out.

### /api/2.0/vdn/traceflow

To find the ID of a VM vNIC, do the following:
1. In the vSphere MOB, navigate to the VM you want to connect or disconnect.
2. Click **config** and take note of the **instanceUuid**.
3. Click **hardware** and take note of the last three digits of the
appropriate network interface device.

Use these two values to form the VM vNIC ID.  For example, if the
**instanceUuid** is *502e71fa-1a00-759b-e40f-ce778e915f16* and the
appropriate **device** value is *device[4000]*, the **objectId** and

### /2.0/nwfabric/configure
Working with Network Virtualization Components and VXLAN
---
Cluster preparation can be broken down into the following:
  * Install VIB and non-VIB related action: Before any per-host config
  a VIB must be installed on the host. The feature can use this time to
  perform other bootstrapping tasks which do not depend on
  VIB-installation. e.g. VXLAN creates the vmknic-pg and sets up some
  opaque data.
  * Post-VIB install: Prepare each host for the feature. In the case of
  VXLAN, create vmknics.

* **post** *(secured)*: Install network fabric or VXLAN.

This method can be used to perform the following tasks: 
* Install Network Virtualization Components
* Configure VXLAN
* Configure VXLAN with LACPv2
* Reset Communication Between NSX Manager and a Host or Cluster

Removing network virtualization components removes previously
installed VIBs, tears down NSX Manager to ESXi messaging, and removes
any other network fabric dependent features such as logical switches.
If a feature such as logical switches is being used in your
environment, this call fails.

Removing VXLAN does not remove the network virtualization components
from the cluster.

## securityFabric
Working with Security Fabric and Security Services
======
The security fabric simplifies and automates deployment of security
services and provide a platform for configuration of the elements that are
required to provide security to workloads. These elements include:

Internal components:
* Guest Introspection Universal Service Virtual Machine
* Guest Introspection Mux
* Data Security
* Logical Firewall

External components:
* Partner OVFs / VIBs
* Partner vendor policy templates

For partner services, the overall workflow begins with registration of
services by partner consoles, followed by deployment of the services by
the administrator.

Subsequent workflow is as follows:
1. Select the clusters on which to deploy the security fabric (Mux,
Traffic filter, USVM).
2. Specify an IP pool to be used with the SVMs (available only if the
partner registration indicates requirement of static IPs)
3. Select portgroup (DVPG) to be used for each cluster (a default is
pre-populated for the user).
4. Select datastore to be used for each cluster (a default is
pre-populated for the user).
5. NSX Manager deploys the components on all hosts of the selected
clusters.

Once you deploy the security fabric, an agency defines the configuration
needed to deploy agents (host components and appliances). An agency is
created per cluster per deployment spec associated with services.  Agents
are deployed on the selected clusters, and events / hooks for all the
relevant actions are generated.

**Request parameters**

Parameter | Description 
-------|---------
dataStoreÂ |Â Needs to be specified only in POST call. In PUT call, it should be left empty. 
dvPortGroupÂ |Â Optional. If not specified, then user will set the Agent using vCenter Server. 
ipPoolÂ |Â Optional. If not specified, IP address is assigned through DHCP. 
startTimeÂ |Â Time when the deployment task(s) are scheduled for. If this is not specified then deployment will happen immediately.

## eventControl
Working with Data Collection for Activity Monitoring
===========
Activity Monitoring provides visibility into your virtual network to
ensure that security policies at your organization are being enforced
correctly.

A Security policy may mandate who is allowed access to what applications.
The Cloud administrator can generate Activity Monitoring reports to see if
the IP based firewall rule that they set is doing the intended work. By
providing user and application level detail, Activity Monitoring
translates high level security policies to low level IP address and
network based implementation.

Once you enable data collection for Activity Monitoring, you can run
reports to view inbound traffic (such as virtual machines being accessed
by users) as well as outbound traffic (resource utilization, interaction
between inventory containers, and AD groups that accessed a server).

You must enable data collection for one or more virtual machines on a
vCenter Server before running an Activity Monitoring report. Before
running a report, ensure that the enabled virtual machines are active and
are generating network traffic.

You should also register NSX Manager with the AD Domain Controller. See
"Working with Domains".

Note that only active connections are tracked by Activity Monitoring.
Virtual machine traffic blocked by firewall rules at the vNIC level is not
reflected in reports.

In case of an emergency such as a network overload, you can turn off data
collection at a global level. This overrides all other data collection
settings.

Some API calls may require the VMID, which is the MOID of the guest
virtual machine. You can retrieve this by queuing the vCenter mob
structure (https:VC-IP-Address/mob). The VMID is listed under host
structure.

### /1.0/eventcontrol/vm/{vmID}/request
Working With Data Collection on a Specific Virtual Machine
----
You must enable data collection at least five minutes before running an
Activity Monitoring report.

* **post** *(secured)*: Enable or disable data collection on a virtual machine

Set **value** to *enabled* or *disabled*.

### /1.0/eventcontrol/eventcontrol-root/request
Override Data Collection
----

* **post** *(secured)*: Turn data collection on or off at the global level.

In case of an emergency such as a network overload, you can turn off
data collection at a global level (kill switch). This overrides all
other data collection settings.

Set **value** to *enabled* or *disabled*.

### /1.0/eventcontrol/config/vm/{vmID}
Retrieve Data Collection Configuration for a Specific Virtual Machine
-----
When reporting per virtual machine configuration, current kill switch
status is also reported too. The effective configuration of a virtual
machine is determined by both kill switch config and per virtual machine
configuration. If kill switch is on, event collection is effectively
disabled regardless of what its per virtual machine configuration is; if
kill switch is off, per virtual machine configuration determines whether
event collection should be performed for this virtual machine.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve per VM configuration for data collection.

## domain
Working with Domains
===========
After you create a domain, you can apply a security policy to it and run
queries to view the applications and virtual machines being accessed by
the users of a domain.

### /1.0/directory/updateDomain
Registering Domains
---------------
You can a register one or more Windows domains with an NSX Manager and
associated vCenter server.  NSX Manager gets group and user information
as well as the relationship between them from each domain that it is
registered with. NSX Manager also retrieves Active Directory
credentials.  You can apply security policies on an Active Directory
domain and run queries to get information on virtual machines and
applications accessed by users within an Active Directory domain.

**Parameter Values for Registering or Updating a Domain**

Parameter Name | Description | Mandatory? 
----------------|-------------|------------
ID |  Domain id.  If you want to create a new domain, do not provide this value.  Otherwise, the system will find an existing domain object by this ID and update it. | true if update existing domain 
name |  Domain name.  This should be domain's full qualified name. In case agent discovered, this will be NetBIOS name, so you need to update it to FQN in order to support LDAP sync and event log reader. | true if creating a new domain. 
description | Domain description | false 
type | Domain type. Valid value include: AGENT_DISCOVERED, ActiveDirectory, SPECIAL (Do NOT modify SPECIAL domain). For LDAP sync and event log reader work, this need to be set to ActiveDirectory. | true if creating a new domain 
netbiosName |  NetBIOS name of domain. This is Domain's NetBIOS name. Check windows domain setting, for value of it. Normally Agent report domain name is NetBIOS name. But confirm from Windows domain setting. | false 
baseDn | Domain's Base DN (for LDAP sync).  Base DN is REQUIRED for LDAP Sync. If you have a domain like: w2k3.vshield.vmware.com, the base DN is very likely to be: DC=w2k3,DC=vshield,DC=vmware,DC=com. Another example is: domain name is: vs4.net, the base DN should be: DC=vs4,DC=net. You can use a LDAP client and connect to domain controller to find the domain's base DN. |  false 
rootDn | LDAP Sync root DN.  Specify where should LDAP sync start from LDAP tree. This could be absolute path, for example: OU=Engineer,DC=vs4,DC=net, or relative path (relate to Base DN), for example: OU=Engineer. |  false
securityId | Domain's Security ID (SID). This should be filled by LDAP sync process, and should not need to be modified. |  false 
username |  Domain's User name (Used for LDAP Sync and/or Event Log reader) | false 
password | User password | false
eventLogUsername | Domain's event log reader username (will use above username if this is NULL) | false
eventLogPassword | Domain's event log reader password | false

## guestIntrospection
Working with Guest Introspection and Third-party Endpoint Protection (Anti-virus) Solutions
============

About Guest Introspection and Endpoint Protection Solutions
----------
VMware's Guest Introspection Service enables vendors to deliver an
introspection-based, endpoint protection (anti-virus) solution that uses
the hypervisor to scan guest virtual machines from the outside, with only
a thin agent on each guest virtual machine.

Version Compatibility
-----------

**Note:** The management APIs listed in this section are to be used only
with partner endpoint protection solutions that were developed with EPSec
Partner Program 3.0 or earlier (for vShield 5.5 or earlier).  These
partner solutions are also supported on NSX 6.0 and need the APIs listed
below.  These APIs should not be used with partner solutions developed
specifically for NSX 6.0 or later, as these newer solutions automate the
registration and deployment process by using the new features introduced
in NSX.  Using these with newer NSX 6.0 based solutions could result in
loss of features.

Register a Solution
----------

To register a third-party solution with Guest Introspection, clients can
use four REST calls to do the following:
1. Register the vendor.
2. Register one or more solutions.
3. Set the solution IP address and port (for all hosts).
4. Activate registered solutions per host.

**Note:** Steps 1 through 3 need to be performed once per solution. Step 4
needs to be performed for each host.

Unregister a Solution
----------

To unregister a solution, clients perform these steps in reverse:
1. Deactivate solutions per host.
2. Unset a solutionâs IP address and port.
3. Unregister solutions.
4. Unregister the vendor.

Updating Registration Information
-----------

To update registration information for a vendor or solution, clients must:
1. Unregister the vendor or solution.
2. Reregister the vendor or solution.

### /2.0/endpointsecurity/registration

The following table lists the elements that can be used in firewall
rules.

| Element | Keyword for API | Used in |
|---|---|---|
| All Edges | ALL_EDGES | appliedTo |

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve distributed firewall rule configuration.

If no query parameters are used, all rule configuration is retrieved.
Use the query parameters to filter the rule configuration information.

* **put** *(secured)*: Update the complete firewall configuration in all sections.

* Retrieve the configuration with `GET /api/4.0/firewall/globalroot-0/config`.
* Retrieve the Etag value from the response headers.
* Extract and modify the configuration from the response body as needed.
* Set the If-Match header to the Etag value, and submit the request.

Not all fields are required while sending the request. All the optional fields
are safe to be ignored while sending the configuration to server. For example,
if an IP set is referenced in the rule only IPSet and Type is needed in the
Source/Destination objects and not Name and isValid tags.

When updating the firewall configuration:
* IDs for new objects (rule/section) should be removed or set to zero.
* If new entities (sections/rules) have been sent in the request, the response
  will contain the system-generated IDs, which are assigned to these new
  entities.
* **appliedTo** can be any valid firewall rule element.
* **action** can be *ALLOW*, *BLOCK*, or *REJECT*. REJECT sends reject message for
  unaccepted packets; RST packets are sent for TCP connections and ICMP
  unreachable code packets are sent for UDP, ICMP, and other IP connections
* source and destination can have an exclude flag. For example, if you add an
  exclude tag for 1.1.1.1 in the source parameter, the rule looks for traffic
  originating from all IPs other than 1.1.1.1.

* **delete** *(secured)*: Restore default configuration.

Restores a configuration with one defaultLayer3 section with default
allow rule and one defaultLayer2Section with default allow rule.

### /4.0/firewall/globalroot-0/config/layer3sections
Working With Layer 3 Sections in Distributed Firewall
-----

You can use sections in the firewall table to group logical rules based on
AppliedTo or for a tenant use case. A firewall section is the smallest unit of
configuration which can be updated independently. Section types are as
follows:
* Layer3Section contains layer3 rules
* Layer2Section contains layer2 rules
* Layer3RedirectSection contains traffic redirect rules.

When Distributed Firewall is used with Service Composer, firewall sections
created by Service Composer contain an additional attribute in the XML called
managedBy. You should not modify Service Composer firewall sections using
Distributed Firewall REST APIs.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve rules from the layer 3 section specified by section
**name**.

* **post** *(secured)*: Create a layer 3 distributed firewall section.

By default, the section is created at the top of the firewall table.
You can specify a location for the section with the **operation**
and **anchorId** query parameters.

### /4.0/firewall/globalroot-0/config/layer3sections/{sectionId}
Working With a Specific Layer 3 Distributed Firewall Section
----

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve information about the specified layer 3 section.
* **post** *(secured)*: Move the specified layer 3 section.

Use the **action**, **operation**, and optionally **achorId**
query parameters to specify the destination for the section.

`POST /api/4.0/firewall/globalroot-0/config/layer3sections/1007
?action=revise&operation=insert_before&anchorId=1006`

`If-Match: 1477989118875`

```

* **put** *(secured)*: Update the specified layer 3 section in distributed firewall.

* Retrieve the configuration for the specified section.
* Retrieve the Etag value from the response headers.
* Extract and modify the configuration from the response body as needed.
* Set the If-Match header to the Etag value, and submit the request.

Not all fields are required while sending the request. All the optional fields
are safe to be ignored while sending the configuration to server. For example,

When Distributed Firewall is used with Service Composer, firewall
sections created by Service Composer contain an additional attribute
in the XML called managedBy. You should not modify Service Composer
firewall sections using Distributed Firewall REST APIs. If you do, you
must synchronize firewall rules from Service Composer using the `GET
/api/2.0/services/policy/serviceprovider/firewall` API.

* **delete** *(secured)*: Delete the specified layer 3 distributed firewall section.

### /4.0/firewall/globalroot-0/config/layer3sections/{sectionId}/rules
Working With Distributed Firewall Rules in a Layer 3 Section
----

* **post** *(secured)*: Add rules to the specified layer 2 section in distributed firewall.

You add firewall rules at the global scope. You can then narrow down the scope
(datacenter, cluster, distributed virtual port group, network, virtual machine,
vNIC, or logical switch) at which you want to apply the rule. Firewall allows
you to add multiple objects at the source and destination levels for each rule,
which helps reduce the total number of firewall rules to be added.  To add a
identity based firewall rule, first create a security group based on Directory
Group objects. Then create a firewall rule with the security group as the
source or destination.  Rules that direct traffic to a third part service are
referred to as layer3 redirect rules, and are displayed in the layer3 redirect
tab.

When Distributed Firewall is used with Service Composer, firewall
rules created by Service Composer contain an additional attribute
in the XML called managedBy.

Follow this procedure to add a rule:

* Retrieve the configuration for the specified section.
* Retrieve the Etag value from the response headers.
  **Note**: Each section contains its own Etag, generationNumber, and
  timestamp. When adding a new rule, you must use the Etag value of the
  firewall section to which you wish to add the rule.
* Extract and modify the configuration from the response body as needed.
* Set the If-Match header to the section Etag value, and submit the request.

Not all fields are required while sending the request. All the optional fields
are safe to be ignored while sending the configuration to server. For example,
if an IP set is referenced in the rule only IPSet and Type is needed in the
Source/Destination objects and not Name and isValid tags.

When updating the firewall configuration:

* IDs for new rules should be removed or set to zero.
* If new rules have been sent in the request, the response
  will contain the system-generated IDs, which are assigned to these new

### /4.0/firewall/globalroot-0/state
Enable distributed firewall after upgrade.

After upgrading NSX Manager, controllers, and network virtualization
components, check the status of distributed firewall. If it is ready to
enable, you can enable distributed firewall.

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| backwardCompatible | This is the default state after an upgrade from vCloud Networking and Security to NSX, which means that vShield App is being used for protection instead of distributed firewall.|
| backwardCompatibleReadyForSwitch | Once the clusters are prepared with NSX binaries, this state is enabled. You can enable distributed firewall only after firewall is in this state. |
| switchingToForward | This is an intermediate state when you change firewall to distributed firewall. |
| forward | This is the default state for green field deployments or after you have switched from vShield App to distributed firewall. |
| switchFailed | This state is unlikely, but may be present if NSX Manager failed to switch to distributed firewall. |

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve current state of firewall functioning after NSX upgrade.

* **put** *(secured)*: Enable distributed firewall.

### /4.0/firewall/globalroot-0/status
Working with Distributed Firewall Status
----
Retrieve status of last publish action for each cluster in the NSX
environment.

The status output displays a generation number (**generationNumber**) for
each rule set, which can be used to verify whether a change in rule sets
has propagated to a host. In 6.2.4, a generation number for objects
(**generationNumberObjects**) has been added to the status API. This allows
you to verify whether a change in objects consumed in firewall rules has
propagated to a host. Note that the object generation number may change
frequently and will always be equal to or greater than the ruleset
generation number.

Starting in NSX 6.2.4, clusters (and hosts inside the cluster) are no
longer included in the firewall status output if distributed firewall is
disabled at the cluster level, or if the cluster is not prepared (NSX
VIBs are not installed). In earlier versions of NSX these clusters and
hosts are included in the output. However, because they are not
configured for firewall, after a firewall rule publish their status is
*inprogress*.

* **get** *(secured)*: Get firewall configuration status

**Method history:**

Release | Modification

distributed firewall.

The firewall module generates system events when the memory and CPU
usage crosses these thresholds.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve threshold configuration for distributed firewall.

* **put** *(secured)*: Update threshold configuration for distributed firewall.

### /4.0/firewall/config/globalconfiguration
Working with the Distributed Firewall Global Configuration
----------------------------------------------------------
You can use the following parameters to improve firewall performancer:

* **layer3RuleOptimize** and **layer2RuleOptimize** to turn
on/off rule optimization.
* **tcpStrictOption** determines whether or not to drop an established
TCP connection when the firewall does not see the initial three-way
handshake. If set to true, the connection will be dropped.
* **autoDraftDisabled** improves performances when making large numbers
of changes to firewall rules.

You can disable the auto draft feature by setting **autoDraftDisabled** to
true. Distributed Firewall saves up to 100 configurations, including
manually saved drafts (**preserve** parameter can be set to true or
false) and auto saved drafts (**preserve** parameter is set to false).
Once 100 configurations are saved, older drafts with the **preserve**
parameter set to false will be deleted in order to save new
configurations. You might want to disable the auto drafts feature before
making large numbers of changes to the firewall rules, to improve
performance, and to prevent previously saved drafts from being
overwritten.

Note: The **autoDraftDisabled** parameter does not appear in a GET of the global
configuration.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve performance configuration for distributed firewall.
* **put** *(secured)*: Update the distributed firewall performance configuration.
**Method history:**

## spoofGuard
Working With SpoofGuard
==========
After synchronizing with the vCenter Server, NSX Manager collects the IP
addresses of all vCenter guest virtual machines If a virtual machine has
been compromised, the IP address can be spoofed and malicious
transmissions can bypass firewall policies.

You create a SpoofGuard policy for specific networks that allows you to
authorize the reported IP addresses and alter them if necessary to prevent
spoofing.  SpoofGuard inherently trusts the MAC addresses of virtual
machines collected from the VMX files and vSphere SDK. Operating
separately from Firewall rules, you can use SpoofGuard to block traffic
determined to be spoofed.

### /4.0/services/spoofguard/policies
Working with SpoofGuard Policies
---------
You can create a SpoofGuard policy to specify the operation mode for
specific networks. The system generated policy applies to port groups
and logical switches not covered by existing SpoofGuard policies.

The operationMode for a SpoofGuard policy can be set to one of the
following:

* **TOFU** - Automatically trust IP assignments on their first use
* **MANUAL** - Manually inspect and approve all IP assignments before first
use
* **DISABLE** - Disable the SpoofGuard policy

* **post** *(secured)*: Create a SpoofGuard policy to specify the operation mode for networks.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve informationa about all SpoofGuard policies.

### /2.1/app/flow/flowstats/info
Working with flow monitoring meta-data.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve flow statistics meta-data.

This method retrieves the following information for each flow type:
* minimum start time
* maximum end time
* total flow count

### /2.1/app/flow/config
Working with flow monitoring configuration.

Flow records generated on all hosts are sent to NSX Manager, which
consumes the records and displays aggregated information.  Hosts can
generate large numbers of flow records.  You can configure flow
monitoring to exclude certain records from collection.  The flow
configuration applies to all hosts.

* **collectFlows** - if true, flow collection is enabled.
* **ignoreBlockedFlows** - if true, ignore blocked flows.
* **ignoreLayer2Flows** - if true, ignore layer 2 flows.
* **sourceIPs** - source IPs to exclude. For example: 10.112.3.14, 10.112.3.15-10.112.3.18,192.168.1.1/24.
* **sourceContainer** - source containers to exclude. Containers can contain VM, vNic, IP Set, MAC Set.
* **destinationIPs** - destination IPs to exclude.
* **destinationContainer** - destination containers to exclude. Containers can contain VM, vNic, IP Set, MAC Set.
* **destinationPorts** - destination ports to exclude.
* **serviceContainers** - service containers to exclude. Container can contain application or application group.

Flow exclusion happens at the host. The following flows are discarded by default:
* Broadcast IP (255.255.255.255)
* Local multicast group (224.0.0.0/24)
* Broadcast MAC address (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF)

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve flow monitoring configuration

## nsxEdges
Working with NSX Edge
=======

### /4.0/edges

* **post** *(secured)*: Install NSX Edge services gateway or logical router, depending on request
body.

The NSX Edge installation API copies the NSX Edge OVF from the Edge
Manager to the specified datastore and deploys an NSX Edge on the given
datacenter. After the NSX Edge is installed, the virtual machine powers
on and initializes according to the given network configuration. If an
appliance is added, it is deployed with the specified configuration.

Installing an NSX Edge instance adds a virtual machine to the vCenter
Server inventory, you must specify an IP address for the management
interface, and you may name the NSX Edge instance.

The configuration you specify when you install an NSX Edge is stored in
the database. If an appliance is added, the configuration is applied to
it and it is deployed.

NOTE: Do not use hidden/system resource pool IDs as they are not
supported on the UI.

### /4.0/edges/{edgeId}/dhcp/config
Configure DHCP for NSX Edge
----
NSX Edge provides DHCP service to bind assigned IP addresses to MAC
addresses, helping to prevent MAC spoofing attacks. All virtual
machines protected by a NSX Edge can obtain IP addresses dynamically
from the NSX Edge DHCP service.

NSX Edge supports IP address pooling and one-to-one static IP address
allocation based on the vCenter managed object ID (vmId) and interface
ID (interfaceId) of the requesting client.

If either bindings or pools are not included in the PUT call, existing
bindings or pools are deleted.

NSX Edge DHCP service adheres to the following rules:
* Listens on the NSX Edge internal interface (non-uplink interface)
for DHCP discovery.
* As stated above, vmId specifies the vc-moref-id of the virtual
machine, and vnicId specifies the index of the
vNic for the requesting client. The hostname is an identification of
the binding being created. This hostName is not pushed as the
specified host name of the virtual machine.
* By default, all clients use the IP address of the internal interface
of the NSX Edge as the default gateway address. To override it,
specify **defaultGateway** per binding or per pool. The clientâs broadcast
and subnetMask values are from the internal interface for the
container network.
* **leaseTime** can be infinite, or a number of seconds. If not specified,
the default lease time is 1 day.
* Logging is disabled by default.
* Setting the parameter **enable** to *true* starts the DHCP service
while setting **enable** to *false* stops the service.  
* Both **staticBinding** and **ipPools** must be part of the PUT request body.
Else, they will be deleted if configured earlier.

**DHCP Configuration Paramters**

Parameter Name | Parameter Information 
------|-----
**enabled** | Default is true.
**staticBinding** | Assign an IP address via DHCP statically rather than dynamically. You can either specify **macAddress** directly, or specify **vmId** and **vnicId**. In case both are specified, only **macAddress** will be used; **vmId** and **vnicId** will be ignored.
**staticBinding > macAddress** | Optional.
**staticBinding > vmId** | Optional. The VM must be connected to the specified **vnicId**.
**staticBinding > vnicId** | Optional. Possible values 0 to 9.
**staticBinding > hostname** | Optional. Disallow duplicate.
**staticBinding > ipAddress** | The IP can either belong to a a subnet of one of Edge's vNics or it can be any valid IP address, but the IP must not overlap with any primary/secondary IP addresses associated with any of Edge's vNICs. If the IP does not belong to any Edge vNic subnets, you must ensure that the default gateway and subnetMask are configured via this API call.
**ipPool > ipRange** |  Required. The IP range can either fall entirely within one of the Edge vNIC subnets, or it can be a valid IP range outside any Edge subnets. The IP range, however, cannot contain an IP that is defined as a vNic primary secondary IP. If the range does not fall entirely within one of the Edge vNIC subnets, you must provide correct **subnetMask** and **defaultGateway**.
**defaultGateway**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Optional. If the ipRange (for ipPool) or assigned IP (for staticBinding) falls entirely within one of the Edge vNIC subnets, **defaultGateway** is set to the primary IP of the vNIC configured with the matching subnet.  Otherwise, you must provide the correct gateway IP. If an IP is not provided, the client host may not get default gateway IP from the DHCP server.
**subnetMask**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Optional. If not specified, and the the ipRange (for ipPool) or assigned IP (for staticBinding) belongs to an Edge vNic subnet, it is defaulted to the subnet mask of this vNic subnet. Otherwise, it is defaulted to a minimum subnet mask which is figured out with the IP range itself, e.g. the mask of range 192.168.5.2-192.168.5.20 is 255.255.255.224. You can edit this range, if required.
**domainName** <br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Optional.
**primaryNameServer**<br>**secondaryNameServer**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool)|  Optional. If **autoConfigureDNS** is *true*, the DNS primary/secondary IPs will be generated from DNS service (if configured).
**leaseTime**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Optional. In seconds, default is *86400*. Valid **leaseTime** is a valid number or *infinite*. 
**autoConfigureDns**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) |  Optional. Default is *true*. 
**nextServer**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Global TFTP server setting. If an IP pool or static binding has a TFTP server configured via **option66** or **option150**, that server will be used instead.
**dhcpOptions** <br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Optional.
**dhcpOptions > option121**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Add a static route.
**dhcpOptions > option121 > destinationSubnet**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Destination network, for example 1.1.1.4/30.
**dhcpOptions > option121 > router**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Router IP address.
**dhcpOptions > option66**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Hostname or IP address of a single TFTP server for this IP pool.
**dhcpOptions > option67**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Filename to be downloaded from TFTP server.
**dhcpOptions > option150**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | IP address of TFTP server.
**dhcpOptions > option150 > server**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Use to specify more than one TFTP server by IP address for this IP Pool.
**dhcpOptions > option26**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | MTU.
**dhcpOptions > other**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Opaque options.
**dhcpOptions > other > code**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | 
**dhcpOptions > other > value**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | 
**logging** | Optional. Logging is disabled by default.
**logging > enable** |  Optional, default is *false*.
**logging > logLevel** | Optional, default is *info*.

## policy
Working with Security Policies and Actions
============================

### /2.0/services/policy/securitypolicy
Working with Security Policies
------------------------------
A security policy is a set of Endpoint, firewall, and network
introspection services that can be applied to a security group.

* **post** *(secured)*: Create a security policy.

When creating a security policy, a parent security policy can be
specified if required. The security policy inherits services from the
parent security policy. Security group bindings and actions can also
be specified while creating the policy. Note that execution order of
actions in a category is implied by their order in the list. The
response of the call has Location header populated with the URI using
which the created object can be fetched.

Ensure that:
* the required VMware built in services (such as Distributed Firewall,
  Data Security, and Endpoint) are installed. See *NSX Installation
  Guide*.
* the required partner services have been registered with NSX Manager.
* the required security groups have been created.

Tags related to Service Composer, security policies, and security
groups:
Common Tags
* **actionType** - Defines the type of action belonging to a given
executionOrderCategory
* **executionOrderCategory** - Category to which the action belongs to
(endpoint, firewall or traffic_steering)
* **isActive** - In a security policy hierarchy, an action within a policy
may or may not be active based on the
precedence of the policy or usage of isActionEnforced flag in that
hierarchy
* **isActionEnforced** - Enforces an action of a parent policy on its
child policies for a given actionType and
executionOrderCategory. Note that in a policy hierarchy, for a given
actionType and executionOrderCategory, there can be only one action
which can be marked as enforced.
* **isEnabled** - Indicates whether an action is enabled
* **secondarySecurityGroup** - Applicable for actions which need secondary
security groups, say a
source-destination firewall rule
* **securityPolicy** - Parent policy in an action
Output only Tags
* **executionOrder** - Defines the sequence in which actions belonging to
an executionOrderCategory are
executed. Note that this is not an input parameter and its value is
implied by the index in the list.
Firewall Category Tags
* **action** - Allow or block the traffic
* **applications** - Applications / application groups on which the rules
are to be applied
* **direction** - Direction of traffic towards primary security group.
Possible values: inbound, outbound, intra
* **logged** - Flag to enable logging of the traffic that is hit by this
rule
* **outsideSecondaryContainer** - Flag to specify outside i.e. outside
securitygroup-3
Endpoint Category Tags
* **serviceId** - ID of the service (as registered with the service
insertion module). If this tag is null, the
functionality type (as defined in actionType tag) is not applied which
will also result in blocking the actions (of given functionality type)
that are inherited from the parent security policy. This is true if
there is no action of enforce type.
* **invalidServiceId** - Flag to indicate that the service that was
referenced in this rule is deleted, which make
the rule ineffective (or deviate from the original intent that existed
while configuring the rule). You must either modify this rule by
adding correct Service or delete this rule.
* **serviceName** -Name of the service
* **serviceProfile** - Profile to be referenced in Endpoint rule.
* **invalidServiceProfile** - Flag to indicate that the service profile
that was referenced in this rule is deleted, which makes
the rule ineffective (or deviate from the original intent that existed
while configuring the rule). You must either modify this rule by
adding correct Service Profile or delete this rule.
The following tags are deprecated:
* **vendorTemplateId**
* **invalidVendorTemplateId**
* **vendorTemplateName**
Traffic Steering/NetX Category Tags
* **redirect** - Flag to indicate whether to redirect the traffic or not
* **serviceProfile** - Service profile for which redirection is being
configured
* **logged** - Flag to enable logging of the traffic that is hit by this
rule

### /2.0/services/policy/securitypolicy/status

### /2.0/services/policy/securitypolicy/serviceprovider/firewall
Working with Service Composer Firewall Applied To Setting
-------------
You can set the applied to setting for all firewall rules created
though Service Composer to either Distributed Firewall or Policy's
Security Groups. By default, the applied to is set to Distributed
Firewall. When Service Composer firewall rules have an applied to
setting of distributed firewall, the rules are applied to all clusters
on which distributed firewall is installed. If the firewall rules are
set to apply to the policy's security groups, you have more granular
control over the firewall rules, but may need multiple security
policies or firewall rules to get the desired result.

**Applied To Values for Service Composer Firewall Rules**

Value | Description
------|----------
dfw_only | Firewall rules are applied to all clusters on which Distributed Firewall is installed.
policy_security_group | Firewall rules are applied to security groups on which the security policy is applied.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve the Service Composer firewall applied to setting.

* **put** *(secured)*: Update the Service Composer firewall applied to setting.

### /2.0/services/policy/securitypolicy/{ID}

To update a security policy, you must first fetch it.
Then edit the received XML and pass it back as the input. The
specified configuration replaces the current configuration.

Security group mappings provided in the PUT call replaces the
security group mappings for the security policy. To remove all
mappings, delete the securityGroupBindings parameter.

You can add or update actions for the security policy by editing the
actionsByCategory parameter. To remove all actions (belonging to all
categories), delete the actionsByCategory parameter. To remove
actions belonging to a specific category, delete the block for that
category.

* **delete** *(secured)*: Delete a security policy.

When you delete a security policy, its child security policies and
all the actions in it are deleted as well.

### /2.0/services/policy/securitypolicy/{ID}/securityactions
Working with Security Actions on a Security Policy
-------------

Category are sorted based on the weight of security actions in
descending order.

### /2.0/services/policy/securitypolicy/hierarchy
Working With Security Policy Configuration Hierarchies
-----

* **post** *(secured)*: Import a security policy configuration

You can create multiple security policies and parent-child
hierarchies using the data fetched through export. All objects
including security policies, security groups and security actions
are created on a global scope.

The policy that is being imported needs to be included in the
request body.

If a suffix is specified, it is added after the names of the
security policy, security action, and security group objects in the
exported XML. The suffix can thus be used to differentiate locally
created objects from imported ones.

The location of the newly created security policy objects (multiple
locations are separated by commas) is populated in the Location
header of the response.

* **get** *(secured)*: Export a Service Composer configuration (along with the
security groups to which the security policies are mapped).
You can save the response to a file.  The saved configuration can be
used as a backup for situations where you may accidentally delete a
policy configuration, or it can be exported for use in another NSX
Manager environment.

If a prefix is specified, it is added before the names of the
security policy, security action, and security group objects in the
exported XML. The prefix can thus be used to indicate the remote
source from where the hierarchy was exported.

### /2.0/services/policy/securityaction/category/virtualmachines
Working with Virtual Machines with Security Actions Applied
--------------

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve all VirtualMachine objects on which security action of a

## nsxCli
Working with the Central CLI
=======

### /1.0/nsx/cli

* **post** *(secured)*: The central command-line interface (central CLI) commands are run from the
NSX Manager command line, and retrieve information from the NSX Manager and other
devices. These commands can also be executed in the API.

You can insert any valid Central CLI command as the **command**
parameter. For a complete list of the Central CLI commands executable
through the API, please see the Central CLI chapter of the *NSX Command
Line Interface Reference*.

## inventoryStatus
Communication Status
====================
This feature allows the user to check the connection status between the
NSX Manager and hosts. A hash map is used to hold all hosts' connection
status. It keeps track of the latest heartbeat from each host.  When
querying a hostâs connection status, NSX Manager will get the latest
heartbeat information to compare the last heartbeat time and current time.
If the duration is longer than a threshold, it returns *DOWN*, otherwise
it returns *UP*. If no last heartbeat information is found and this host
has not been prepared or the netcpa version on this host is lower than
6.2.0, it will return *NOT_AVAILABLE*.  But if no last heartbeat
information is found and the host has been prepared with netcpa version no
less than 6.2.0, it will return *DOWN*. When a host has been unprepared,
its heartbeat information will be removed from the NSX Manager memory.
