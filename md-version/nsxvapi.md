## vdsManage
Working with vSphere Distributed Switches
===========

### /2.0/vdn/switches

* **post** *(secured)*: Prepare a vSphere Distributed Switch.
___
The MTU is the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted in one
packet before it is divided into smaller packets. VXLAN frames are slightly
larger in size because of the traffic encapsulation, so the MTU required
is higher than the standard MTU. You must set the MTU for each switch to
1600 or higher.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve information about all vSphere Distributed Switches.

### /2.0/vdn/switches/datacenter/{datacenterID}
Working with vSphere Distributed Switches in a Datacenter
------

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve information about all vSphere Distributed Switches in the specified datacenter.

### /2.0/vdn/switches/{vdsId}
Working With a Specific vSphere Distributed Switch
------

## vdnConfig
Working with Segement ID Pools and Multicast Ranges
========

### /2.0/vdn/config/segments
Working with segment ID pools
-------------
Segment ID pools (also called segment ID ranges) provide virtual network
identifiers (VNIs) to logical switches.
___
You must configure a segment ID pool for each NSX Manager. You can have
more than one segment ID pool. The segment ID pool includes the beginning
and ending IDs.
___
You should not configure more than 10,000 VNIs in a single vCenter
server because vCenter limits the number of dvPortgroups to 10,000.
___
If any of your transport zones will use multicast or hybrid replication
mode, you must also configure a multicast address range.

* **post** *(secured)*: Add a segment ID pool.
___
* **name** - Required property.
* **desc** - Optional property.
* **begin** - Required property. Minimum value is *5000*
* **end** - Required property. Maximum value is *16777216*

If the segment ID pool is universal you must send the API request to
the primary NSX Manager.

### /2.0/vdn/config/multicasts
Working with Multicast Address Ranges
------
If any of your transport zones will use multicast or hybrid replication
mode, you must add a multicast address range (also called a multicast
address pool). Specifying a multicast address range helps in spreading
traffic across your network to avoid overloading a single multicast
address.

* **post** *(secured)*: Add a multicast address range for logical switches.
___
The address range includes the beginning and ending addresses.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve information about all configured multicast address ranges.
___

    specified, the **controlPlaneMode** of the transport zone is used. It
    can be one of the following:
      * *UNICAST_MODE*
      * *HYBRID_MODE*
      * *MULTICAST_MODE*
  * **guestVlanAllowed** - Optional. Default is *false*.

## traceflows
Working with Traceflow
================
For Traceflow to work as expected, make sure that the controller cluster is
connected and in healthy state. The Traceflow operation requires active
communication between vCenter, NSX Manager, controller cluster, and netcpa
User World Agents (UWA) on the host. Traceflow observes marked packet as it
traverses overlay network. Each packet is delivered to host VM and
monitored as it crosses overlay network until it reaches the destination
VM. The packet is never delivered to the destination guest VM. This means
that Traceflow packet delivery is successful even when the guest VM is
powered down. Unknown L2 Packets are always be sent to the bridge.
Typically, the bridge forwards these packets to a VLAN and reports the
Traceflow packet as delivered. The packet which is reported as delivered
need not necessarily mean that the trace packet was delivered to the
destination specified. You should conclude only after validating the
observations.vdl2 serves ARP proxy for ARP packets coming from VMs.
However, traceflow bypasses this process, hence vdl2 may broadcast the
traceflow packet out.

edited. For example, you can nest the following security groups within
an upgraded security group at the datacenter scope:

* security groups created at same datacenter scope (via REST only)
* security groups created at portgroup scope, which fall under the
datacenter (via REST only).

Security groups created at the global scope cannot be nested under a
security group created at a lower scope such as a
datacenter.

## nwfabric
Working with Network Fabric Configuration
=====

### /2.0/nwfabric/configure
Working with Network Virtualization Components and VXLAN.
___
Cluster preparation can be broken down into the following:
  * Install VIB and non-VIB related action: Before any per-host config
  a VIB must be installed on the host. The feature can use this time to
  perform other bootstrapping tasks which do not depend on
  VIB-installation. e.g. VXLAN creates the vmknic-pg and sets up some
  opaque data.
  * Post-VIB install: Prepare each host for the feature. In the case of
  VXLAN, create vmknics.

* **post** *(secured)*: Install network fabric or VXLAN.
___
You install the network infrastructure components in your virtual
environment on a per-cluster level for each vCenter server, which
deploys the required software on all hosts in the cluster. This software
is also referred to as an NSX vSwitch. When a new host is added to this
cluster, the required software is automatically installed on the newly
added host. After the network infrastructure is installed on a cluster,
Logical Firewall is enabled on that cluster.
___
See examples for the following tasks:
* Install Network Virtualization Components
* Configure VXLAN
* Configure VXLAN with LACPv2
* Reset Communication
___
| Name | Comments |
|------|----------|
|**resourceId** | vCenter MOB ID of cluster. For example, domain-7. A host can be specified when resetting communication. For example, host-24. |
|**featureId** | Feature to act upon. Omit for network virtualization components operations. Use *com.vmware.vshield.vsm.vxlan* for VXLAN operations, *com.vmware.vshield.vsm.messagingInfra* for message bus operations.|

|**uplinkPortName** | The *uplinkPortName* as specified in vCenter.|

* **put** *(secured)*: Upgrade Network virtualization components.
____
This API call can be used to upgrade network virtualization components.
After NSX Manager is upgraded, previously prepared clusters must have
the 6.x network virtualization components installed.

___
Removing network virtualization components removes previously
installed VIBs, tears down NSX Manager to ESXi messaging, and removes
any other network fabric dependent features such as logical switches.
If a feature such as logical switches is being used in your
environment, this call fails.
___
Removing VXLAN does not remove the network virtualization components
from the cluster.
___
| Name | Comments |
|------|----------|

## guestIntrospection
Working with Guest Introspection and Third-party Endpoint Protection (Anti-virus) Solutions
============

About Guest Introspection and Endpoint Protection Solutions
----------
VMware's Guest Introspection Service enables vendors to deliver an introspection-based, endpoint protection (anti-virus) solution
that uses the hypervisor to scan guest virtual machines from the outside, with only a thin agent on each guest virtual machine.

Version Compatibility
-----------

**Note:** The management APIs listed in this section are to be used only with partner endpoint protection solutions
that were developed with EPSec Partner Program 3.0 or earlier (for vShield 5.5 or earlier).
These partner solutions are also supported on NSX 6.0 and need the APIs listed below.
These APIs should not be used with partner solutions developed specifically for NSX 6.0 or later, as
these newer solutions automate the registration and deployment process by using the new features introduced in NSX.
Using these with newer NSX 6.0 based solutions could result in loss of features.

Register a Solution
----------

To register a third-party solution with Guest Introspection, clients can use four REST calls to do the following:
1. Register the vendor.
2. Register one or more solutions.
3. Set the solution IP address and port (for all hosts).
4. Activate registered solutions per host.

**Note:** Steps 1 through 3 need to be performed once per solution. Step 4 needs to be performed for each host.

Unregister a Solution
----------

To unregister a solution, clients perform these steps in reverse:
1. Deactivate solutions per host.
2. Unset a solutionâs IP address and port.
3. Unregister solutions.
4. Unregister the vendor.

Updating Registration Information
-----------

To update registration information for a vendor or solution, clients must:
1. Unregister the vendor or solution.
2. Reregister the vendor or solution.

### /2.0/endpointsecurity/registration

## dfw
Working with Distributed Firewall
=================================

### /4.0/firewall/globalroot-0/config
Distributed firewall rules configuration
___
The following table lists the elements that can be used in firewall
rules.
___
| Element | Keyword for API | Used in |
|---|---|---|
| All Edges | ALL_EDGES | appliedTo |
| application | Application | service |
| application group | ApplicationGroup | service |

| virtual app | VirtualApp | source/destination |
| virtual machine | VirtualMachine | source/destination<br>appliedTo |
| vNIC | Vnic | source/destination<br>appliedTo |

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve distributed firewall rule configuration.
___
If no query parameters are used, all rule configuration is retrieved.
Use the query parameters to filter the rule configuration information.

* **put** *(secured)*: Update the complete firewall configuration in all sections.

* Retrieve the configuration with `GET /api/4.0/firewall/globalroot-0/config`.
* Retrieve the Etag value from the response headers.
* Extract and modify the configuration from the response body as needed.
* Set the If-Match header to the Etag value, and submit the request.

Not all fields are required while sending the request. All the optional fields
are safe to be ignored while sending the configuration to server. For example,
if an IP set is referenced in the rule only IPSet and Type is needed in the
Source/Destination objects and not Name and isValid tags.

When updating the firewall configuration:
* IDs for new objects (rule/section) should be removed or set to zero.
* If new entities (sections/rules) have been sent in the request, the response
  will contain the system-generated IDs, which are assigned to these new
  entities.
* **appliedTo** can be any valid firewall rule element.
* **action** can be *ALLOW*, *BLOCK*, or *REJECT*. REJECT sends reject message for
  unaccepted packets; RST packets are sent for TCP connections and ICMP
  unreachable code packets are sent for UDP, ICMP, and other IP connections
* source and destination can have an exclude flag. For example, if you add an
  exclude tag for 1.1.1.1 in the source parameter, the rule looks for traffic
  originating from all IPs other than 1.1.1.1.

* **delete** *(secured)*: Restore default configuration.
___
Restores a configuration with one defaultLayer3 section with default
allow rule and one defaultLayer2Section with default allow rule.

### /4.0/firewall/globalroot-0/config/layer3sections
Working with layer 3 sections in distributed firewall.

You can use sections in the firewall table to group logical rules based on
AppliedTo or for a tenant use case. A firewall section is the smallest unit of
configuration which can be updated independently. Section types are as
follows:
* Layer3Section contains layer3 rules
* Layer2Section contains layer2 rules
* Layer3RedirectSection contains traffic redirect rules.

When Distributed Firewall is used with Service Composer, firewall sections
created by Service Composer contain an additional attribute in the XML called
managedBy. You should not modify Service Composer firewall sections using
Distributed Firewall REST APIs.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve rules from the layer 3 section specified by section
**name**.

* **post** *(secured)*: Create a layer 3 distributed firewall section.
___
By default, the section is created at the top of the firewall table.
You can specify a location for the section with the **operation**
and **anchorId** query parameters.

### /4.0/firewall/globalroot-0/config/layer3sections/{sectionId}
Working with a specific layer 3 distributed firewall section.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve information about the specified layer 3 section.
* **post** *(secured)*: Move the specified layer 3 section.
* **put** *(secured)*: Update the specified layer 3 section in distributed firewall.

* Retrieve the configuration for the specified section.
* Retrieve the Etag value from the response headers.
* Extract and modify the configuration from the response body as needed.
* Set the If-Match header to the Etag value, and submit the request.

Not all fields are required while sending the request. All the optional fields
are safe to be ignored while sending the configuration to server. For example,
if an IP set is referenced in the rule only IPSet and Type is needed in the
Source/Destination objects and not Name and isValid tags.

When Distributed Firewall is used with Service Composer, firewall
sections created by Service Composer contain an additional attribute
in the XML called managedBy. You should not modify Service Composer
firewall sections using Distributed Firewall REST APIs. If you do, you
must synchronize firewall rules from Service Composer using the `GET
/api/2.0/services/policy/serviceprovider/firewall` API.

* **delete** *(secured)*: Delete the specified layer 3 distributed firewall section.

### /4.0/firewall/globalroot-0/config/layer3sections/{sectionId}/rules
Working with distributed firewall rules in a layer 3 section.

* **post** *(secured)*: Add rules to the specified layer 2 section in distributed firewall.

You add firewall rules at the global scope. You can then narrow down the scope
(datacenter, cluster, distributed virtual port group, network, virtual machine,
vNIC, or logical switch) at which you want to apply the rule. Firewall allows
you to add multiple objects at the source and destination levels for each rule,
which helps reduce the total number of firewall rules to be added.  To add a
identity based firewall rule, first create a security group based on Directory
Group objects. Then create a firewall rule with the security group as the
source or destination.  Rules that direct traffic to a third part service are
referred to as layer3 redirect rules, and are displayed in the layer3 redirect
tab.

When Distributed Firewall is used with Service Composer, firewall
rules created by Service Composer contain an additional attribute
in the XML called managedBy.

Follow this procedure to add a rule:

* Retrieve the configuration for the specified section.
* Retrieve the Etag value from the response headers.
  **Note**: Each section contains its own Etag, generationNumber, and
  timestamp. When adding a new rule, you must use the Etag value of the
  firewall section to which you wish to add the rule.
* Extract and modify the configuration from the response body as needed.
* Set the If-Match header to the section Etag value, and submit the request.

Not all fields are required while sending the request. All the optional fields
are safe to be ignored while sending the configuration to server. For example,
if an IP set is referenced in the rule only IPSet and Type is needed in the
Source/Destination objects and not Name and isValid tags.

  **Note**: This is the Etag value of the firewall section to which you want
  to add the rule. If you are keeping this rule in the same section, you must
  keep the same Etag number.
* Extract and modify the rule configuration from the response body as needed.
* Set the If-Match header to the section Etag value, and submit the request.

Not all fields are required while sending the request. All the optional fields

Enable distributed firewall after upgrade.
___
After upgrading NSX Manager, controllers, and network virtualization
components, check the status of distributed firewall. If it is ready to
enable, you can enable distributed firewall.
___
| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| backwardCompatible | This is the default state after an upgrade from vCloud Networking and Security to NSX, which means that vShield App is being used for protection instead of distributed firewall.|
| backwardCompatibleReadyForSwitch | Once the clusters are prepared with NSX binaries, this state is enabled. You can enable distributed firewall only after firewall is in this state. |
| switchingToForward | This is an intermediate state when you change firewall to distributed firewall. |
| forward | This is the default state for green field deployments or after you have switched from vShield App to distributed firewall. |
| switchFailed | This state is unlikely, but may be present if NSX Manager failed to switch to distributed firewall. |

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve current state of firewall functioning after NSX upgrade.

* **put** *(secured)*: Enable distributed firewall.

### /4.0/firewall/globalroot-0/status
Working with Distributed Firewall Status
----
Retrieve status of last publish action for each cluster in the NSX
environment.

The status output displays a generation number (**generationNumber**) for
each rule set, which can be used to verify whether a change in rule sets
has propagated to a host. In 6.2.4, a generation number for objects
(**generationNumberObjects**) has been added to the status API. This allows
you to verify whether a change in objects consumed in firewall rules has
propagated to a host. Note that the object generation number may change
frequently and will always be equal to or greater than the ruleset
generation number.

Starting in NSX 6.2.4, clusters (and hosts inside the cluster) are no
longer included in the firewall status output if distributed firewall is
disabled at the cluster level, or if the cluster is not prepared (NSX
VIBs are not installed). In earlier versions of NSX these clusters and
hosts are included in the output. However, because they are not
configured for firewall, after a firewall rule publish their status is
*inprogress*.

* **get** *(secured)*: Get firewall configuration status

**Method history:**

Release | Modification

on/off rule optimization.
* **tcpStrictOption** determines whether or not to drop an established
TCP connection when the firewall does not see the initial three-way
handshake. If set to true, the connection will be dropped.
* **autoDraftDisabled** improves performances when making large numbers
of changes to firewall rules.

You can disable the auto draft feature by setting **autoDraftDisabled** to
true. Distributed Firewall saves up to 100 configurations, including
manually saved drafts (**preserve** parameter can be set to true or
false) and auto saved drafts (**preserve** parameter is set to false).
Once 100 configurations are saved, older drafts with the **preserve**
parameter set to false will be deleted in order to save new
configurations. You might want to disable the auto drafts feature before
making large numbers of changes to the firewall rules, to improve
performance, and to prevent previously saved drafts from being
overwritten.

Note: The **autoDraftDisabled** parameter does not appear in a GET of the global
configuration.

## policy
Working with Security Policies and Actions
============================

### /2.0/services/policy/securitypolicy
Working with Security Policies
------------------------------
A security policy is a set of Endpoint, firewall, and network
introspection services that can be applied to a security group.

* **post** *(secured)*: Create a security policy.
___
When creating a security policy, a parent security policy can be
specified if required. The security policy inherits services from the
parent security policy. Security group bindings and actions can also
be specified while creating the policy. Note that execution order of
actions in a category is implied by their order in the list. The
response of the call has Location header populated with the URI using
which the created object can be fetched.
___
Ensure that:
* the required VMware built in services (such as Distributed Firewall,
  Data Security, and Endpoint) are installed. See *NSX Installation
  Guide*.
* the required partner services have been registered with NSX Manager.
* the required security groups have been created.
___
Tags related to Service Composer, security policies, and security
groups:
Common Tags
* **actionType** - Defines the type of action belonging to a given
executionOrderCategory
* **executionOrderCategory** - Category to which the action belongs to
(endpoint, firewall or traffic_steering)
* **isActive** - In a security policy hierarchy, an action within a policy
may or may not be active based on the
precedence of the policy or usage of isActionEnforced flag in that
hierarchy
* **isActionEnforced** - Enforces an action of a parent policy on its
child policies for a given actionType and
executionOrderCategory. Note that in a policy hierarchy, for a given
actionType and executionOrderCategory, there can be only one action
which can be marked as enforced.
* **isEnabled** - Indicates whether an action is enabled
* **secondarySecurityGroup** - Applicable for actions which need secondary
security groups, say a
source-destination firewall rule
* **securityPolicy** - Parent policy in an action
Output only Tags
* **executionOrder** - Defines the sequence in which actions belonging to
an executionOrderCategory are
executed. Note that this is not an input parameter and its value is
implied by the index in the list.
Firewall Category Tags
* **action** - Allow or block the traffic
* **applications** - Applications / application groups on which the rules
are to be applied
* **direction** - Direction of traffic towards primary security group.
Possible values: inbound, outbound, intra
* **logged** - Flag to enable logging of the traffic that is hit by this
rule
* **outsideSecondaryContainer** - Flag to specify outside i.e. outside
securitygroup-3
Endpoint Category Tags
* **serviceId** - ID of the service (as registered with the service
insertion module). If this tag is null, the
functionality type (as defined in actionType tag) is not applied which
will also result in blocking the actions (of given functionality type)
that are inherited from the parent security policy. This is true if
there is no action of enforce type.
* **invalidServiceId** - Flag to indicate that the service that was
referenced in this rule is deleted, which make
the rule ineffective (or deviate from the original intent that existed
while configuring the rule). You must either modify this rule by
adding correct Service or delete this rule.
* **serviceName** -Name of the service
* **serviceProfile** - Profile to be referenced in Endpoint rule.
* **invalidServiceProfile** - Flag to indicate that the service profile
that was referenced in this rule is deleted, which makes
the rule ineffective (or deviate from the original intent that existed
while configuring the rule). You must either modify this rule by
adding correct Service Profile or delete this rule.
The following tags are deprecated:
* **vendorTemplateId**
* **invalidVendorTemplateId**
* **vendorTemplateName**
Traffic Steering/NetX Category Tags
* **redirect** - Flag to indicate whether to redirect the traffic or not
* **serviceProfile** - Service profile for which redirection is being
configured
* **logged** - Flag to enable logging of the traffic that is hit by this
rule

Working with Service Composer Firewall Applied To Setting
-------------
You can set the applied to setting for all firewall rules created
though Service Composer to either Distributed Firewall or Policy's
Security Groups. By default, the applied to is set to Distributed
Firewall. When Service Composer firewall rules have an applied to
setting of distributed firewall, the rules are applied to all clusters
on which distributed firewall is installed. If the firewall rules are
set to apply to the policy's security groups, you have more granular
control over the firewall rules, but may need multiple security
policies or firewall rules to get the desired result.

**Applied To Values for Service Composer Firewall Rules**

Value | Description

hierarchies using the data fetched through export. All objects
including security policies, security groups and security actions
are created on a global scope.
___
The policy that is being imported needs to be included in the
request body.
___
If a suffix is specified, it is added after the names of the
security policy, security action, and security group objects in the
exported XML. The suffix can thus be used to differentiate locally
created objects from imported ones.
___
The location of the newly created security policy objects (multiple
locations are separated by commas) is populated in the Location
header of the response.

* **get** *(secured)*: Export a Service Composer configuration (along with the
security groups to which the security policies are mapped).
You can save the response to a file.  The saved configuration can be
used as a backup for situations where you may accidentally delete a
policy configuration, or it can be exported for use in another NSX
Manager environment.
___
If a prefix is specified, it is added before the names of the
security policy, security action, and security group objects in the
exported XML. The prefix can thus be used to indicate the remote
source from where the hierarchy was exported.

## inventoryStatus
Communication Status
====================
This feature allows the user to check the connection status between the
NSX Manager and hosts. A hash map is used to hold all hosts' connection
status. It keeps track of the latest heartbeat from each host.  When
querying a hostâs connection status, NSX Manager will get the latest
heartbeat information to compare the last heartbeat time and current time.
If the duration is longer than a threshold, it returns *DOWN*, otherwise
it returns *UP*. If no last heartbeat information is found and this host
has not been prepared or the netcpa version on this host is lower than
6.2.0, it will return *NOT_AVAILABLE*.  But if no last heartbeat
information is found and the host has been prepared with netcpa version no
less than 6.2.0, it will return *DOWN*. When a host has been unprepared,
its heartbeat information will be removed from the NSX Manager memory.
